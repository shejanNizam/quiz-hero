        <h3>Qsn: Difference betweem map, forEach,filter, find ??</h3>
        <p>
          Ans: The map() method creates a new array populated with the results
          of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
          <br />
          Foreach takes a callback function and run that callback function on
          each element of array one by one. <br />
          Whenever you have to filter an array Javascript inbuilt method to
          filter your array is the right choice to use. Filter let you provide a
          callback for every element and returns a filtered array. <br />
          The find() method returns the first element in the provided array that
          satisfies the provided testing function. If no values satisfy the
          testing function, undefined is returned.

          Qsn: Difference between local storage, session storage ,cookies ??
        </h3>
        <p>
          Ans: Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need
          to access later, such as offline data. Session storage is a great way
          to improve the performance of your web applications. Cookies are a
          good choice for storing data that should not be persisted for a long
          time, such as session IDs
